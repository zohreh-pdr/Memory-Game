A responsive and interactive browser-based Memory Card Game built with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  
This project was developed as part of my frontend learning journey, focusing on clean structure, modular logic, and real-world deployment.

It was built as a learning project to practice:

- DOM manipulation
- Modular JavaScript
- Game logic implementation
- LocalStorage usage
- Code refactoring & version improvement
- Deployment using GitHub Pages
